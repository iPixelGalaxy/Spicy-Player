# Spicy Player

Spicy Player is an offline music player for Android with a port/recreation of [Spicy Lyrics](https://github.com/Spikerko/spicy-lyrics) - A [Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) Extension, designed to achieve **visual parity** with Spicy Lyrics' rendering. Built using **Jetpack Compose (Canvas API)** and **ExoPlayer**.

This repo also includes an **iOS SwiftUI app target** under [ios/project.yml](ios/project.yml). The iOS version keeps the same local-file workflow: load an audio file, automatically pair a same-name `.ttml` file beside it, then render synchronized lyrics during playback.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a work in progress. The app is not yet complete and may have bugs.

## Key Features

### High-Fidelity Lyrics Rendering
- **Sub-Pixel Text Positioning**: Uses Compose's `TextMeasurer` for exact glyph calculation. 
- **Duet-Aware Layout**: Identifies primary (`v1`) and guest (`v2`) artists from TTML metadata.
- **Intelligent Alignment**: Primary artists are justified to the left, and guest artists to the right, with multi-line blocks correctly right-aligned for balance.

### Physics-Driven Motion
- **Analytic Spring Engine**: Replaces traditional Euler/Verlet integration with a mathematically exact (closed-form) solution for damped harmonic oscillators. This ensures that a target set 500ms in the future is reached exactly, with zero energy drift.
- **Critical Damping (ζ = 1.0)**: Used for all auto-scroll centering to provide the fastest non-oscillatory return possible.
- **Under-damped Springs**: Used for word-bouncing and interlude-dot expansions to provide a lively, bouncy character.

### Synchronized Animations
- **Held Word Bounce**: Syllables with a duration `>= 1000ms` automatically receive a bouncy scale and Y-offset animation, highlighting them letter-by-letter.
- **Instrumental Break Dots**: Injected automatically for gaps `>= 3000ms`, featuring a "breathe" pulse effect synced with the song's timing.
- **Seamless Seek**: Clicking any lyric line instantly re-bases the physics spring to the current visual position, ensuring no "snap-back" jumps when transitioning from manual scrolling back to auto-focus.

## Project Architecture & Core Logic

### 1. The Rendering Pipeline (`LyricsRenderer.kt`, `SpicyLyricsView.kt`)
The app uses a single-pass rendering loop that updates at the device's native refresh rate (60Hz/90Hz/120Hz).
- **Coordinate Systems**:
    - **`Canvas Space`**: (0, 0) is the top-left of the view.
    - **`Scroll Space`**: A virtual Y-coordinate where the lyrics live.
    - **`Screen Center`**: Used as the anchor point for the active line focus.
- **Calculations**: `targetY = -clusterCenterY` (where the cluster is the average Y-position of all currently active lines).

### 2. The Physics Solver (`SpringSimulation.kt`)
Solving $x'' + 2\zeta\omega x' + \omega^2 x = \omega^2 \cdot \text{goal}$ for $x(t)$:
- **Critically Damped ($\zeta = 1$)**: $x(t) = (x_0 + (v_0 + \omega x_0)t)e^{-\omega t}$
- **Under-damped ($\zeta < 1$)**: $x(t) = e^{-\zeta\omega t}(A \cos(\omega_d t) + B \sin(\omega_d t))$ 
This ensures perfect smoothness regardless of fluctuating frame times.

### 3. TTML Parser (`TtmlLyricsParser.kt`)
A stateful XML parser that:
1. Scans for `<ttm:agent>` metadata to identify primary artists.
2. Tokenizes `<p>` tags into high-precision `Word` objects.
3. Injects virtual `Line` objects for instrumental breaks.

## Roadmap

### Lyrics Visuals
- [x] **TTML Parsing & Agent Mapping**: Correctly separating singer roles.
- [x] **Lyrics Canvas**: Single-pass high-performance rendering.
- [x] **Dynamic Glow & Spline Highlights**: Smooth karaoke-style color wipes.
- [x] **Motion Cancellation**: Freezes auto-scroll when the user interacts, returning after 4s of idle time.
- [ ] **Lyrics Theming**: Customizable font faces, size multipliers, and blur intensities.

### Audio Engine
- [x] **Media3 ExoPlayer Wrapper**: Handle FLAC, MP3, and WAV.
- [x] **Lyric Auto-Pairing**: Match `.flac` and `.ttml` based on file name prefix.
- [ ] **Gapless Playback**: Implement a customized `ConcatenatingMediaSource` for seamless transitions.
- [ ] **Equalizer & Reverb**: Native Android audio effects integration.

### User Experience (UI/UX)
- [x] **Adaptive Launch Icons**: 15dp inset foreground with a 108dp safety margin. 
- [ ] **Music Library**: A folder-based scanner that caches metadata and covers locally. 
- [ ] **Player Controls**: Drag-to-dismiss "Now Playing" sheet with Musicolet-style layouts.

## Tech Stack

- **Jetpack Compose**: For the entire UI declaration and Canvas manipulation.
- **Media3 (ExoPlayer)**: Industrial-grade media decoding and playback.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: For non-blocking IO during TTML and audio file scanning.
- **Custom XML Pull Parser**: For lightweight, low-memory performance on large lyric files.
- **SwiftUI + AVFoundation**: For the iOS player, local file importing, and synchronized lyric rendering.

## Manual Builds

GitHub Actions includes a manual workflow at [.github/workflows/build-mobile.yml](.github/workflows/build-mobile.yml).

- `platform`: build `android`, `ios`, or `both`
- `android_variant`: build `Debug` or `Release`
- `ios_export`: export a signed `ipa` or an unsigned `simulator-app`
- `ios_export_method`: choose `development`, `ad-hoc`, or `app-store` for IPA exports

### iOS Signing Secrets

IPA export requires these GitHub repository secrets:

- `IOS_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64`
- `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
- `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`
- `IOS_TEAM_ID`
- `IOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY`

The workflow generates the Xcode project from [ios/project.yml](ios/project.yml) using XcodeGen on the macOS runner, then archives and exports the app.
